        <p>
            As a member of the Princeton class of 2024, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science with
            minors in Statistics & Machine Learning, Finance, Urban Studies, and Architecture/Engineering. I am most
            interested in opportunities that allow me to merge my interests in finance, real estate, design, media, and
            architecture with my passion for Computer Science.
